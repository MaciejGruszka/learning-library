## Creating Db Schema, Loading Application Data and Creating Weblogic DataSource ##

### Introduction ###

This lab goes through the process of loading application data into DBCS. First we would create a Application specific user in DBCS after which we would be creating required tables and loading the application data. 

Once the data loading is complete we would create a DataSocurce in weblogic using which application can access the data.


### Steps ###

There are three major steps in order to deploy an Applcation on JCS:
1. Creating DB schema and loading data
2. Creating weblogic DataSource

#### 1. Log into your Cloud Account ####
