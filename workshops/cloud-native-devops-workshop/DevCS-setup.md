### New Developer Cloud Service Setup ###

Oracle Developer Cloud Service now supports integration with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage Classic.

You can create virtual machines (VMs) on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic and use them to run builds of your projects. The archived build artifacts and Maven artifacts are stored on the containers of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage Classic.

After sign in if you do not see Developer service than, on the My Services   Dashboard page, in the **developer _id_** tile, click **Action**![the Action menu icon](./Linking Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage Classic with Oracle Developer Cloud Service_files/dashboard_actions_menu.png), and select **Open Service Console.**If Oracle Developer Cloud Service isn't listed on the dashboard, click **Customize Dashboard.** Under **Platform,** find **developer _id_,** click **Show,** and then close the **Customize Dashboard** window.

Here are four steps for DevCS setup:
