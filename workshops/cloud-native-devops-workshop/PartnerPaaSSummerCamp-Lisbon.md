# ORACLE Java and Cloud Native Application Development with the Oracle Cloud #

## Introduction ##

Oracle Cloud is the industryâ€™s broadest and most integrated public cloud. It offers best-in-class services across software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and even lets you put Oracle Cloud in your own data center. Oracle Cloud helps organizations drive innovation and business transformation by increasing business agility, lowering costs, and reducing IT complexity. The workshop content shows different aspects of Application Development in the cloud with different set of Oracle Cloud Services.

### Prerequisites ###

In order to run labs it is necessary to setup environment, including source code cloning from github.

--, setup PATH variable for executing maven. 
--Script for environment setup is [here](EnvSetup.md). 


DevCS setup

Before you start creating projects in Oracle Developer Cloud Service, configure Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage Classic services of your identity domain with Oracle Developer Cloud Service, then create Build VM template with selecting software for your build and create Build VM. Detailed steps are [here](DevCS-setup.md).

### Important ###

During the execution you will create several public cloud service instances what will be available on the world wide web. Even if these instances are for demo purposes keep in mind it is not a best practice to use weak or known (stored here in the tutorial) passwords especially in such open environment. Thus this workshop content does not recommend any password so you need to define those. You will be asked to provide password at certain points and please remember them for later usage.

The content contains several independent modules that cover different aspects of the application development in the Oracle Cloud. These modules could be executed independently unless you find in the Prerequisites that they are dependent on each other.
