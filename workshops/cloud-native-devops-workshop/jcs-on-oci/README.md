# ORACLE Cloud-Native DevOps workshop #

## Create Java Cloud Service instance using user interface on Oracle Cloud Infractructure (JCS on OCI) ##

### Introduction ###

The Oracle Java Cloud Service (JCS) provides a cloud-based application server (Oracle WebLogic Server with automated customer-controlled provisioning, backup, patching, scaling with cloud tooling) designed to support any Java application. You may use the Oracle Java Cloud Service through the Oracle Java Cloud Service console and quickly create and configure Java EE application environment.

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) platform can run both Oracle workloads and cloud native applications, it offer highly available infrastructure ideal for enterprise applications and provide greater control over the network. This all adds up to great price-performance for Weblogic deployment.
